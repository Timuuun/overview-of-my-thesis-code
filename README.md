# Overview of my work on sudoku with Integer Linear Programming
This is an overview over the code/data associated with my thesis

## Integer Linear Programming
Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is an extension of Linear Programming (LP) to address LP problems with decision variables that are non-negative integers. ILP problems often encountered in everyday practice include scheduling courses, stations or airports, employee task schedules within a company, company maintenance, and many others. The development of techniques for solving ILP problems has progressed rapidly due to advancements in computer technology, which have concurrently progressed, leading to many software tools that can solve LP problems more efficiently.
